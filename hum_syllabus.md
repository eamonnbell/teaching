## Textbook (required)

Thomas Forrest Kelly, _First Nights: Five Musical Premieres_, (Yale: Yale University Press, 2001)

Used copies are available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0300091052/) for as low as $10, and copies are available in the [Columbia University Libraries](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/2603535). Please take care not to accidentally acquire the similarly-titled _First Nights at the Opera_, by the same author.

## Assessment breakdown

- Final exam (40%)
- Writing assignments (3, each equally weighted) (30%)
- Weekly scheduled quizzes (about 12, each equally weighted) (20%)
- Attendance (see below) (10%)

## Assessment policies

* All writing assignments must be turned in at the start of the class on the day in which they are due, usually a Monday.
* Late assignments will only be accepted on the next scheduled class meeting following the original due date of the assignment, and a penalty will be applied when calculating the grade for that assignment (see below). After that date, the score for that assignment will be set to 0%.
* The value of the final grade for a late assignment will reduced by one fifth (20%). If it is impossible to complete the assignment on time for religious reasons, athletics, or personal/family emergency, please let me know as soon as possible, to make alternative arrangements.
* Quizzes will be graded as either not satisfactory (NS) or satisfactory (S). The total amount awarded for the grade element is computed based on the number of quizzes completed satisfactorily by the student.
* Importantly, quizzes may not be retaken or rescheduled. If a student achieves an NS grade in, or is absent for, a quiz for _any_ reason (i.e. excused or no), the student may turn in a short and original written response to a question relevant to the material examined on that quiz and this response will be graded similarly (not satisfactory/satisfactory) without the option of a redo. These responses will be typically due on the class immediately following the class in which the graded quiz is returned.

## Schedule

A full schedule, including listening and reading assignments will be available online - typically you will see about 5–6 class meetings ahead. Please check the course website linked from Courseworks for more details and a link to the latest version of the schedule.

## Attendance

"Students are expected to attend every session of their Core classes [...] Students who miss class without instructor permission should expect to have their grade lowered. Core instructors have discretion as to the specifics of their in[di]vidual attendance requirements within these general parameters. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with their specific instructor's expectations and requirements (all Core instructors outline attendance and grading policies on their class syllabus)."

The above is taken from the Core policy on attendance detailed [here](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/reg).

Accordingly, attendance at scheduled class meetings, quizzes and examinations is a requirement of this course, and will be recorded regularly at the start of class meetings. The entire attendance element of the course grade is awarded automatically; more than two unexcused absences from scheduled class meetings will result in the deduction of 2% (i.e. 20% of the grade element) of the final grade for each additional absence, up to a maximum of 10% (i.e. 100% of the grade element).

Excusable absences are strictly limited to: (1) absence for religious reasons; (2) absence to facilitate participation in athletics; (3) absence on account of personal illness; (4) absences on account of personal/family emergency.

Advance notification is required in order for your absence to be excused in the case of (2) only; it is appreciated in all other cases. Of course, I understand this is not always possible. Please contact me as soon as possible to be excused from class. Suitable written evidence (e.g. physician’s letter) may be required in some cases. You may consult my records of your attendance at any time. 

You are also required to attend a performance of Verdi's _La traviata_ at the Metropolitan Opera. The ticket cost is $5, the result of a signficiant subsidy by the University in recognition of the unique opportunity it affords students. We are provisionally scheduled to attend on Saturday 25 March, from 8:30 p.m. to late. 

## Academic Integrity

Adapted from [Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity](https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity-statement)

The intellectual venture in which we are all engaged requires of faculty and students alike the highest level of personal and academic integrity. As members of an academic community, each one of us bears the responsibility to participate in scholarly discourse and research in a manner characterized by intellectual honesty and scholarly integrity.

Scholarship, by its very nature, is an iterative process, with ideas and insights building one upon the other. Collaborative scholarship requires the study of other scholars' work, the free discussion of such work, and the explicit acknowledgement of those ideas in any work that inform our own. This exchange of ideas relies upon a mutual trust that sources, opinions, facts, and insights will be properly noted and carefully credited.

In practical terms, this means that, as students, you must:

* be responsible for the full citations of others' ideas in all of your research papers and projects;
* be scrupulously honest when taking your examinations
* always submit your own work and not that of another student, scholar, or internet agent.

Any breach of this intellectual responsibility is a breach of faith with the rest of our academic community. It undermines our shared intellectual culture, and it cannot be tolerated. Students failing to meet these responsibilities should anticipate being asked to leave Columbia.

## Disability-related academic accommodations

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, students must first be registered with Disability Services (DS). More information on the DS registration process is available online at [https://www.health.columbia.edu/ods](https://www.health.columbia.edu/ods). Faculty must be notified of registered students’ accommodations before exam or other accommodations will be provided. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability are invited to contact Disability Services for a confidential discussion at (212) 854-2388 (Voice/TTY) or by email at <disability@columbia.edu>.

## Classroom etiquette

* Food and drink is not permitted in Music Department classrooms.
* The use of electronic devices is not permitted during class.
