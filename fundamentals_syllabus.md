## Short description


The goal of this course is to: equip students with the skills required to accurately notate, read, and appreciate music, using staff notation.


## Student learning outcomes


Students will develop a practical understanding of select fundamental concepts of music theory including interval, scale, key, triad, rhythm, through their application in written assignments and study of musical scores. Where appropriate, examples will be drawn from a wide range of repertoire. The course will stress the development of fluency in the practices of score-reading and handwritten staff notation, and the development of an appreciation for music and musical culture, while drawing on fundamental concepts of music theory to further these aims.

## Schedule



## Attendance


Attendance at scheduled class meetings, quizzes and examinations is a requirement of this course, and will be recorded regularly. 


The entire attendance element of the grade is awarded automatically; more than one unexcused absence from scheduled class meetings will result in the deduction of 2% (i.e. 20% of the grade element) of the final grade per additional absence, up to a maximum of 10% (i.e. 100% of the grade element).


Excusable absences are limited to: (1) absence for religious reasons; (2) absence to facilitate participation in athletics; (3) absence on account of personal illness; (4) absences on account of personal/family emergency.


Advance notification is required in order for your absence to be excused in the case of (2) only; it is appreciated in all other cases. Of course, this is not always possible. Please contact me as soon as possible to be excused from class. Suitable written evidence (e.g. physician’s letter) may be required in some cases. You may consult your attendance record at any time. 


## Academic Integrity
Adapted from Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity (https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity-statement)


The intellectual venture in which we are all engaged requires of faculty and students alike the highest level of personal and academic integrity. As members of an academic community, each one of us bears the responsibility to participate in scholarly discourse and research in a manner characterized by intellectual honesty and scholarly integrity.

Scholarship, by its very nature, is an iterative process, with ideas and insights building one upon the other. Collaborative scholarship requires the study of other scholars' work, the free discussion of such work, and the explicit acknowledgement of those ideas in any work that inform our own. This exchange of ideas relies upon a mutual trust that sources, opinions, facts, and insights will be properly noted and carefully credited.

In practical terms, this means that, as students, you must:


* be responsible for the full citations of others' ideas in all of your research papers and projects;
* be scrupulously honest when taking your examinations
* always submit your own work and not that of another student, scholar, or internet agent.


Any breach of this intellectual responsibility is a breach of faith with the rest of our academic community. It undermines our shared intellectual culture, and it cannot be tolerated. Students failing to meet these responsibilities should anticipate being asked to leave Columbia.
