## Assessment policies

* All assignments must be turned in at the start of the class on the day in which they are due, usually a Tuesday.
* Assessment including a notation task of any kind must have those portions completed in pencil, unless otherwise stated in the assignment instructions. Assignments of this kind that are not completed in pencil will not be graded, and returned to the student for resubmission, as if the assignment was late.
* Late assignments will only be accepted on the next scheduled class meeting following the original due date of the assignment, and a penalty will be applied when calculating the grade for that assignment (see below). After that date, the score for that assignment will be set to 0%.
* The value of the final grade for a late assignment will reduced by one fifth (20%). If it is impossible to complete the assignment on time for religious reasons, athletics, or personal/family emergency, please let me know as soon as possible, to make alternative arrangements.

## Schedule

Reading (usually from Snodgrass, though supplemented with handouts) is assigned for every class, and is to be completed in advance of the class for which it is assigned. Assignments are issued weekly (unless a quiz or exam is on the horizon), usually on a Thursday and are due the following Tuesday. Assignments, quizzes, and exams will be returned with a score ex 100 and a letter grade.

## Attendance

Attendance at scheduled class meetings, quizzes and examinations is a requirement of this course, and will be recorded regularly. 

The entire attendance element of the grade is awarded automatically; more than three unexcused absences from scheduled class meetings will result in the deduction of 2% (i.e. 20% of the grade element) of the final grade for each additional absence, up to a maximum of 10% (i.e. 100% of the grade element).

Excusable absences are limited to: (1) absence for religious reasons; (2) absence to facilitate participation in athletics; (3) absence on account of personal illness; (4) absences on account of personal/family emergency.

Advance notification is required in order for your absence to be excused in the case of (2) only; it is appreciated in all other cases. Of course, I understand this is not always possible. Please contact me as soon as possible to be excused from class. Suitable written evidence (e.g. physician’s letter) may be required in some cases. You may consult my records of your attendance at any time. 

## Academic Integrity
Adapted from [Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity](https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity-statement)

The intellectual venture in which we are all engaged requires of faculty and students alike the highest level of personal and academic integrity. As members of an academic community, each one of us bears the responsibility to participate in scholarly discourse and research in a manner characterized by intellectual honesty and scholarly integrity.

Scholarship, by its very nature, is an iterative process, with ideas and insights building one upon the other. Collaborative scholarship requires the study of other scholars' work, the free discussion of such work, and the explicit acknowledgement of those ideas in any work that inform our own. This exchange of ideas relies upon a mutual trust that sources, opinions, facts, and insights will be properly noted and carefully credited.

In practical terms, this means that, as students, you must:

* be responsible for the full citations of others' ideas in all of your research papers and projects;
* be scrupulously honest when taking your examinations
* always submit your own work and not that of another student, scholar, or internet agent.

Any breach of this intellectual responsibility is a breach of faith with the rest of our academic community. It undermines our shared intellectual culture, and it cannot be tolerated. Students failing to meet these responsibilities should anticipate being asked to leave Columbia.

## Disability-related academic accommodations

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, students must first be registered with Disability Services (DS). More information on the DS registration process is available online at [https://www.health.columbia.edu/ods](https://www.health.columbia.edu/ods). Faculty must be notified of registered students’ accommodations before exam or other accommodations will be provided. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability are invited to contact Disability Services for a confidential discussion at (212) 854-2388 (Voice/TTY) or by email at <disability@columbia.edu>.

## Classroom etiquette

* Food and drink is not permitted in Music Department classrooms.
* The use of electronic devices is not permitted during class.
