## Assignments

Weekly assignments will be available here shortly after the class they were released.

### Assignment 1 [[pdf]](01.pdf) - Due 9/13 in class

- Question 0 is just a really useful (and optional) online drill. Aim to be able to get 19/20 right in 2 minutes. No need to email me your report [[link]](http://www.musictheory.net/exercises/note/brwyrybynyynry)
- Question 4 should read "Notate the following whole and half steps above the given pitch as indicated..." (i.e. omit "and below")
- You can ignore the clef questions referring to the alto clef without penalty. If you like, check out the material [here](https://musictheoryblog.blogspot.com/2006/12/alto-and-tenor-clefs.html) and attempt the questions.

### Assignment 2 [[pdf]](02.pdf) - Due 9/20 in class
